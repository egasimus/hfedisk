# HFEDisk

HFEDisk is a tiny library implementing part of the HFE disk image formqat
as used by [Gotek HxC floppy emulators](https://hxc2001.com/docs/gotek-floppy-emulator-hxc-firmware/pages/emulation-from-images.html).

This repo is branched off from [Dawless](https://github.com/egasimus/dawless)
and re-added as a submodule, so history can be found there.
